        <h3>History of Osijek</h3>
        <p>
          The origins of human habitation of Osijek dates back to Neolithic times, with the first known inhabitants belonging to the Illyrians
           and later invading Celtic tribes. After the conquest of Pannonia, Osijek, known at the time as Mursa, was under the administration and
           protection of the Roman 7th legion which maintained a military castrum at the colony and a bridge over the river Drava. Roman emperor
           Hadrian raised the old settlement of Mursa to a colony with special privileges in 131. The earliest recorded mention of Osijek dates
           back to 1196. The town was a feudal property of Kórógyi family between 1353 and 1472. After the death of the last Kórógyi, King Mathias
           granted it to the Rozgonyi family.
